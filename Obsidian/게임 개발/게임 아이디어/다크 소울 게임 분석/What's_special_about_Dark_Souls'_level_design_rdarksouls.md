Level design that is consistent, makes sense, and has intrinsic "fun" build into it. Let me explain.

In DkS games, usually if we can see something, we can get to it.

There's no invisible wall.  
No teleport points that joins two different areas together (except for Sens to Anor Londo).  
No geography setup that isn't realistic - when you head down, you head _down_ and wouldn't miraculously appear on top of a mountain. (DkS2 is an exception to many examples below..)

Now, what about the place we can see, know we can get to, but don't know how?  
Do you know we can see the Dukes Archive from the Bell Gargoyle area?  
Or that we can see the tree that leads down to Ash Lake from Firelink/upper Blighttown?

That's the true test for level design beauty.  
For example, you can see many items around Undead Burg. But most players wouldn't know how to get to them right away - so they explore. Check the corners, check the doors, try the jumps - and they all make sense!  
There's no "jump to the cliff and turn left, suddenly you can see a tunnel that leads to a hidden area for treasure that you wouldn't have known if you didn't jump."

No, the architecture in Soulsborne games are logical and "functional," and usually we can see our destination from multiple locations.  
"There's nothing attach to the balcony... Maybe I can jump from that rooftop? But how do I get to that roof?"  
"Hmm... There's gotta be somewhere I can drop down to the middle level from upper level, because I'm 99% sure there's nothing at lower level... Yup! Here's an opening!"

The dev team diligently left behind clues like a trail of bread crumbs.  
And often times they reward us for our curiosity.  
"I wonder what happens if I run after this ball... There's clearly a path down."

But there's more.

Good item placement that 1) has lore implications and 2) has meaning in itself and is (sometimes) useful.  
For example, picking up homeward bone before a boss fight.  
Or finding the Ninja set in Blighttown because the ninja didn't die from poison but from the fall.

And then there're the loops.  
In (most) Soulsborne areas, if you miss something in one area, you can always back track.  
That means the area cannot be an one way street - it has to give player the choice to choose between progress and further exploration. And so when we finally figured out a secret in a previous area, we can just go back.

This may seems like a common thing, but it's really not. Many games, Japanese and Western alike, love to lock an area after we've been through it and the only way to revisit the area is to do NG+. Which sucks because not everyone has the free time to replay the same game again just to pick up some items that they clearly didn't need, because they've already beat the game without those items.

In addition, there's the enemy placement and bonfire placement.  
The anor londo archers players hate? There are only two of them. Yup, just two.  
The game gave us a challenge _once_ and got the point across.  
And you don't need me to tell you how good it feels to see a new bonfire.

Finally, the shortcuts.  
If there's a case study on "how to implement shortcuts properly," Soulsborne games are all we need. Hell, the Undead Burg alone has better shortcut designs than most AAA games combined. Or Central Yharnum from BB. Miyazaki designed that level and it shows. A carefully craft military-grade tool for the users to have fun with.

**TL;DR** It's not one thing. It's not a few things. It's doing all of these things right, and they become something greater than the mere sum. In short, Soulsborne games have real souls in them.

Edit: clarity
